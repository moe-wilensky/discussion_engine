Notifications Default Off + Time-Critical Mechanics = Users Will Be Silently Punished
This is the single biggest UX flaw. MRP expiration moves you to observer with no warning if you have notifications off — which is the default state for every new user. A user signs up, gets invited to a discussion, doesn't know there's a countdown, and wakes up next morning to find they're silently locked out. The "opt-in" philosophy is fine for low-stakes notifications, but MRP expiration and voting window closing are not low-stakes. These should either be opt-out by default, or the UI needs a persistent, impossible-to-miss in-app countdown that doesn't depend on notification preferences at all. Arguably both.
MRP Is Cognitively Opaque and It Keeps Moving
You're asking users to internalize a countdown timer that changes every time someone posts. The countdown resets/recalculates after each response. A user might glance at "80 minutes remaining," walk away, come back after 60 minutes expecting to still have time, and find the MRP recalculated down to 40 minutes while they were gone and they're now an observer. This is genuinely disorienting. The UI needs to aggressively communicate that the timer is live and volatile — not just a static countdown. Consider showing the last-recalculated time and what triggered it.
Discussion Creation Asks Users to Set Abstract Parameters
MRL, RTM, and MRM are meaningless numbers to most people. RTM=2 doesn't communicate anything until you understand the full calculation chain. The creation UX needs to either hide these behind presets ("Fast-paced," "Relaxed," "Marathon") with the raw numbers as an optional override, or show a live preview that translates the values into plain language: "With these settings, if people are responding every 30 minutes on average, each person will have about 60 minutes to respond." Without something like this, initiators will set values they don't understand and create broken discussion dynamics.
Voting: Abstention Counts as "No" but That's Never Stated
The resolution rule is simple majority of all eligible voters, not just those who cast votes. This means if 10 people are eligible and only 4 vote (3 yes, 1 no), the motion fails — 3/10 is not a majority. This is a punishing and counterintuitive mechanic. Most voting UIs imply that only cast votes matter. If this is intentional (and it's a reasonable design choice to encourage participation), it needs to be stated explicitly and repeatedly in the UI. Every vote screen should say something like "X of Y eligible voters must agree for this to pass. Currently: 3 yes, 1 no, 6 not yet voted."
The 20% Edit Rule Is a UX Nightmare
How do you show a user "you can change 20% of this"? Character-by-character? A highlighted zone? A diff view after the fact? There's no intuitive way to present "you may alter up to N characters" as an editing experience. This will either feel arbitrary and frustrating, or require a very clever UI pattern that doesn't exist yet in the spec. Options: show a character budget counter that ticks down as you make changes (like a "changes remaining: 47 of 63 characters"), or show a before/after diff. The budget counter approach is probably least disorienting, but it needs to be designed — it's not a standard form element.
Mutual Removal Has No Confirmation Step
User A initiates removal of User B. Both immediately become observers. The spec describes no confirmation dialog, no "are you sure, this will bench you too" warning. Given that initiating 3 removals makes you a permanent observer (platform-wide invite reset included), this needs a friction step. The initiator needs to understand the escalation consequences before they pull the trigger, not after. And that escalation state (how many removals you've initiated in this discussion) needs to be visible somewhere.
Permanent Observer Consequences Are Disproportionate and Poorly Surfaced
One discussion → permanent observer in that discussion → all platform invites reset to 0. This is a cross-context punishment that most users won't expect or understand until it happens. The invite metrics being public means everyone can also see it happened. This needs to be clearly communicated at the point of risk — both when someone is about to initiate a mutual removal and when vote-based removal is being considered. If a user doesn't know that getting voted out in one discussion can gut their ability to invite people in other discussions, that's a spec failure.
The Private Message Reference Is a Ghost Feature
Section 5.3 and 6.3 both state observers "cannot send private messages to active participants." This implies a private messaging system exists. It's described nowhere else in the spec. Either this is a missing feature that needs to be designed, or these sentences are vestigial and should be cut. If messaging exists, it also needs to be scoped — can active participants message each other? Can observers message other observers? This is a dangling thread.
Cold Start Experience Is Hollow
A brand new user can observe discussions but can't participate until someone invites them to a specific discussion. They also need to earn responses before they get their invites (configurable, but nonzero by default in spirit). The new user experience is: arrive, see discussions you can't touch, wait. There's no described onboarding flow, no "here's what to do while you wait," no mechanism to signal to existing users "hey, this person wants to participate." The spec even notes that the discussion initiator can approve uninvited users — but there's no way for an uninvited observer to request that approval. That's a significant missing interaction pattern.
The ≤1 Response Archival Trigger Is Silent and Lethal
If a round gets exactly one response, the discussion is permanently archived. The person who posted that response may have no idea they just ended the discussion. There's no warning like "you are the only person who has responded; if no one else responds before MRP, this discussion will be archived." This needs to be surfaced.
Voting Window and Removal Voting Overlap Is Unaddressed
Both inter-round parameter voting and vote-based removal happen after each round with the same window duration. The spec never says whether these are the same screen, sequential screens, or parallel. From a UX perspective this matters enormously — combining "do you want to adjust the response length?" with "do you want to permanently silence someone?" on the same interface or in the same cognitive session is a very different experience than separating them.

The three things I'd prioritize fixing before any UI work starts: the notification defaults around time-critical events, the discussion creation parameter abstraction, and the confirmation/warning layer around mutual removal and vote-based removal. Everything else is solvable in design iteration. Those three will shape the core feel of the platform if they're wrong.
